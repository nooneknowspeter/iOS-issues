# Solution for Progress Bar Stuck and Error 1109, 3194

If anyone has a problem with updating to 18.1 or in general:

* If stuck on the progress bar, force restart as usual; Volume Up, then Down, Hold Power/Side Button until logo shows then release
* The recovery mode screen will show up
* Connect your phone to your computer

## 3u Tools Method

* Install 3uTools
* Connect your phone and enter the Pro Scan section on 3uTools
* It will prompt you to go into DFU with valid instructions
* Add the ipsw file and install

## iTunes Method (Not the Microsoft Store Version)

* Uninstall all software released by Apple installed from the Microsoft Store, every single one
* Install iTunes from the link below or retrieve the executable from Apple's website
* [Enter DFU using this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC99eOYAQJc)
* iTunes will you a prompt that you're in DFU mode
* Hold down SHIFT and click on restore
* Navigate to the ipsw file
* Install and wait

I haven't tried DFU using the Apple Devices so if anyone tries let me know.

Also, I did not care about my information on my phone so I wiped it clean, if you have any information that you would like on your phone you can try a backup (if you have one) after installing update through DFU but I cannot guarantee that, you have to sacrifice your data and remember your Apple login credentials.

## Update: Solution To Apps Not Installing / Greyed Out

I connected my phone to a public hosted VPN. All the apps are being installed and updated.
